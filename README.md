# Quizzacious
Quizzacious is an offline, multi screen scoreboard for quizzes.

## Reason for developing
Working as a missionary at an NGO in Uganda we sometimes host quizzes. I was looking for an easy piece of software to project a nice scoreboard while managing it on from a laptop, but could not find anything. Online, multi-user scoreboards seem to be there but sometimes you just want something offline. So I thought, why not develop something myself? Since I already had plenty experience with html and css, I just had to revive my javascript knowledge and learn how to deal with electron.

## State of the Code
### What is Working
* Can dynamically create teams from main screen
* Main screen displays teams and displays points
* Points can be added, reduced and set from Main Screen Modals, points are updated instantly
* External Screen shows teams and points in a 2xN grid

### What is not working
* Small gui-design flaws
* FontAwesome does not show nicely yet

### What will work
* ~~Reducing points from main screen~~ done
* ~~Setting points from main screen~~ done
* Removing team from main screen
* ~~External screen~~ done, has basic functionality
* External screen dynamic layout depending on number of teams

### Future dreams
* Multiple scoreboard layouts
* Saving and loading teams/points to file
* Binary packages for Linux, Windows and MacOS

### Very distant future dreams
* Android remote control app
